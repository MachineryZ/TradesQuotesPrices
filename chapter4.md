# Empirical Properties of Limit Order Books

In this chapter, we present some up-to-date statistical results regarding order flow and LOB state for a collection of stocks that we study throughout the book:
1. PCLN Priceline Group Inc.
2. TSLA Tesla Motors Inc.
3. CSCO Cisco Systems Inc.
4. INTC Intel Corp.

CSCO and INTC are large-tick stocks (with a spread close to the minimum value $s\approx \theta$). PCLN and TSLA are small-tick stocks (with a spread much larger than the tick $s>>\theta$)

Some common and notable features should be highlighted:
1. The daily turnover is of the order of 0.5%. This result in face holds across a wide selection of international stocks. This number has roughly doubled from 1995 to 2015（换手率长期保持稳定在 0.5%）
2. The total volume displayed in the LOB within 1% of the mid-price is between 1% and 3% of the daily traded volume（显示在 LOB 的 在 mid-price 1% 附近的 total volume 会在 daily traded volume 的 1% - 3%）
3. The activity at the best quotes takes place at a sub-second time scale (sometimes miliseconds), with much more activity for large-tick stocks than for small-tick stocks. This reflects the importance of queue position for large-tick stocks（最佳报价撮合的时间问题，大票和小票的区别）
4. The number of trade-through market orders (i.e. orders that match at several different prices and therefor walk up the order book) is on the order of a few percent for small-tick stocks and a few per thousand for large-tick stocks（订单被拆分成不同价格的price，对于小票来说，这种order所占比例大概是小几个百分点，对于大票来说时小几个千分点）
